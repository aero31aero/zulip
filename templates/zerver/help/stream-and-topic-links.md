# Stream and topic links

You can easily insert links to streams and topics in your message. These are
useful to help redirect people to correct streams or to link to other relevant
discussions happening on Zulip.

### Stream links

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `#` followed by a few letters from a stream name.

3. Pick the appropriate stream from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

### Topic Links

To link to a topic, you need to specify both the stream and the topic. We
have two similar methods of creating topic links:

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `#` followed by a few letters from a stream name.

3. Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate stream from the autocomplete.

4. Press `>` instead of Enter or Tab.

5. Type a few letters from a topic name.

6. Pick the appropriate topic from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

Alternatively, if you have already completed a stream link, you can:

{start_tabs}

1. Type `>` just after a stream link ends.

2. Type a few letters from a topic name.

3. Pick the appropriate topic from the autocomplete.

{end_tabs}

**Note**: You can also create links to topics that haven't yet been created by
simply typing the name you want that topic to have.
