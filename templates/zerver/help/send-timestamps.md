# Send timestamps

For communities distributed across the world, it is often difficult to
convey time related information like meetings or events to everyone in
chat. Zulip has a powerful feature to help: timestamps.

The same timestamp appears differently to different people. For example,
a person in San Francisco would see:

> Let's have the next meeting on *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:00 AM*.

While someone in India would see:

> Let's have the next meeting on *Thu, May 28 2020, 1:30 PM*.

### Insert a timestamp in your message

{start_tabs}

{!start-composing.md!}

2. Type `!time` and select the option to "pick a date/time".

3. Use the datepicker to select a day and time.

{end_tabs}
